# ProtoMan

This is a simple demo app for exploring [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) with [exprotobuf](https://github.com/bitwalker/exprotobuf). You can find a blog post describing the process on my [blog](https://chase.pursu.es/protobuf-in-elixir-with-exprotobuf.html).

PRs are always welcome.
